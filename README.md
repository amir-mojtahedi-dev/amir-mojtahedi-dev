# Amir Mojtahedi

Junior JavaScript Developer focused on building strong fundamentals and developing an engineering-oriented mindset.

## Profile
I am at an early stage of my software development career, currently concentrating on:
- Core JavaScript concepts (arrays, objects, functions, DOM)
- Writing clear, maintainable, and readable code
- Understanding problem-solving approaches and technical trade-offs

This GitHub profile is intentionally kept minimal and accurate, reflecting my current focus on learning and consistent practice.

## Current Direction
- Strengthening JavaScript fundamentals through structured, regular practice
- Improving code readability, structure, and clarity
- Preparing for junior-level technical interviews
- Building a solid foundation before moving to frameworks and backend development

## Approach
- Prefer clarity over complexity
- Focus on fundamentals before abstraction
- Value steady, incremental progress over rushed results

## Roadmap
- Deepen JavaScript fundamentals through focused practice
- Build small, well-scoped, logic-oriented projects
- Transition to React and backend technologies once the foundation is solid

This profile will evolve gradually as practical experience and real project work are added.
