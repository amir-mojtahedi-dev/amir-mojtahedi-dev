# Amir Mojtahedi

Junior JavaScript Developer with a focus on building strong fundamentals and developing engineering-oriented thinking.

## Profile
I am at an early stage of my software development career, currently concentrating on:
- Core JavaScript concepts (arrays, objects, functions, DOM)
- Writing clear, maintainable code
- Understanding problem-solving approaches and technical trade-offs

This GitHub profile is intentionally kept minimal and accurate, reflecting my current level and ongoing learning process.

## Current Direction
- Strengthening JavaScript fundamentals through consistent practice
- Improving code readability and structure
- Preparing for junior-level technical interviews
- Building a solid base before moving to frameworks and backend development

## Approach
- Prefer clarity over complexity
- Focus on understanding fundamentals before abstraction
- Value steady, incremental progress over rushed results

## Roadmap
- Complete focused JavaScript practice and small logic-oriented exercises
- Progress to minimal, well-scoped projects
- Transition to React and backend technologies when the fundamentals are solid

---

This profile will evolve gradually as practical experience and real project work are added.
